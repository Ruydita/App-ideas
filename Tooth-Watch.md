# Tooth Watch - app to help brush your teeth correctly

Simple watchOS app with timer and periodical taptic feedback to remind you to switch sides while brushing. _Not sure about the Watch limitations in this regard._

iOS app could be used to customize brushing time, number of side switching. Also could send reminders and track streaks maybe?

Main app could also offer hints how to correctly brush your teeth.
