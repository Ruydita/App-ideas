# Photos organizer

iPad app to let users quickly organize photos into albums. This is very cumbersome in Photos since you need to select photos, tap share button, select option to add to album and finally select album. 

In this app you would have two columns. One with photos and the second with albums. User could then drag photos to albums or just tap some kind of icon on an album and it would move the photos there.
