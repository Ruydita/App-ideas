# Share photos to Apple TV easily

Sharing photos with AirPlay via the Share action is _pretty_ cumbersome right now and not very intuitive. Also when you choose to mirror the screen, others can see thumbnails of all your photos or see photos you donâ€™t want to show.

This app allow **easy presentation of photos on Apple TV** with only explicitly selected photos.
I am not sure about the available options but there should be a way to change how app looks on mirrored screen.

Another possibility would be to leverage the [MultipeerConnectivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity) framework and have host tvOS app and guest iOS apps that could be sending pictures directly to it. This way multiple people could present photos.
