# Friend Finder

Use [NearbyInteraction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/nearbyinteraction) framework available in iOS 14 to let people find friends in dense crowds. This uses the U1 chip and is capable of showing the distance between two devices as well as their relative directions. 

Since this needs session established previously I think iMessage app could work well in this case. You would use message to exchange tokens and then start the main app.
