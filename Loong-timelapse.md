# Loong timelapse

#### This is project I have been actually working on for some time but it is pretty complex and I current dont have time and energy to finish it. So I decided to include it in App Ideas.

### The main idea is to let users create timelapses from pictures. You would open the app, create a "project" for one timelapse and then maybe each day/week/month take one picture of the same subject. Could be plant, pet animal, scenery in nature or anything else.

### App would overlay semi-opaque older photo over the camera viewfinder so all the pictures would have very similar composition. Once the user decided there are enough photos, Loong timelapse would produce video using all the photos in given project. There would be options for transitions, how long should each picture get etc.

### Each project could have "details" page with location where the timelapse pictures are being taken with optional reminder like: "Take another picture for timelapse project: XYZ".

_I feel like this is one of the best ideas I got for app so far, but Loong timelapse is complex mainly because you need to handle the camera well and then there is the whole turn series of pictures into video thing. Maybe I will revisit this down the line with SwiftUI. So with iOS 14 maybe.._
