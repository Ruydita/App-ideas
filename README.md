# APP IDEAS

### Collection of ideas for iOS apps that I don't plan to build (probably)..

--- 

# Welcome

I created this repository because I have more ideas for iOS apps than I have time and appetite to execute on them and bring them to AppStore. So I decided to at least share those.

Some ideas are purely textual, for some I created simple concept images which are included. Some ideas are likely very bad and don't make sense or are already implemented.

**Feel free to use any idea, concept** to create new app and launch it in the AppStore. No attribution required, however I would love to see how the ideas look as finished app.
