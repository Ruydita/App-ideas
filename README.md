# App Ideas

# Welcome

I created this repository because I have more ideas for iOS apps than I have time and appetite to execute on them and bring them to AppStore. So I decided to at least share those.

Some ideas are purely textual, for some I created simple concept images which are included. Some ideas are likely very bad and don't make sense or are already implemented.

**Feel free to use any idea, concept** to create new app and launch it in the AppStore. No attribution required, however I would love to see how the ideas look as finished app.

Get in touch on Twitter - [@nemecek_f](https://twitter.com/nemecek_f) to discuss ideas below, some other ideas or just chat :-)
